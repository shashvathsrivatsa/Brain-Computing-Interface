# DATA
The data represents the raw EEG (Electroencephalography) data. EEG records the
electrical activity of the brain over time, and the numbers in the list correspond to the
voltage values measured at specific points in time.

Each number in the list represents the voltage recorded by an electrode on the scalp.
The unit of measurement is usually in microvolts (μV). The EEG data is typically sampled
at a specific rate, measured in samples per second (Hz). The rate at which the data is
sampled will determine the time intervals between consecutive numbers in your list.

measurement: μV (microvolts)
rate: 256 hz
